## Usage Instructions:

1. Save this script as `setup.sh` in your project root directory
2. Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory
3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The script includes error checking to exit if any command fails, creates necessary directories, and provides status messages throughout the process.
